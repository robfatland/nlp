# Natural Language Processing on the public cloud

We tend to work on the cloud; by which we mean AWS, Azure, GCP, and others. 

This repository is about creating a working environment on the cloud; where we can do a little natural language processing.

# Part 1: Preparation

This is presented in outline 'plan' form. I am skipping details for now.

- Set aside a couple hundred dollars (cloud credits or actual money) to pay for some cloud use
- Get a cloud account or subscription
- Learn about cloud security and cost management and follow best practices: 8 hours of "cloud 101" training to start with
- Set up an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine on the cloud; and log in to that VM
- Install Python and a Jupyter notebook server
- Clone this repository on that environment
- Connect to the Jupyter notebook server via secure **`ssh`** connection
- Open the **`nlp.ipynb`** notebook

# Part 2: Natural Language Processing

- Run the notebook!
