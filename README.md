# Natural Language Processing on the public cloud

This tutorial covers building and running a Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis on the cloud.


# Part 1: Preparation

- Set aside a couple hundred dollars (ideally in cloud credits) supporting a cloud account or subscription: AWS, Azure, GCP etcetera
- Learn about cloud security and cost management; follow best practices: Plan on eight hours of "cloud 101" training to start with
    - Links here
- Set up a modest Ubuntu Linux virtual machine on the cloud; and log in to that VM using **`ssh`**
- Install Python and a Jupyter notebook server (Miniconda)
- Clone this repository onto that machine
- Start its Jupyter notebook server and connect, again using a secure **`ssh`** connection
- Open the **`nlp.ipynb`** notebook and follow the notes in **Part 2**

# Part 2: Natural Language Processing

- Open the nlp notebook
